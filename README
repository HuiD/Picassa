Date started: Jan 14 Date completed: Jan 16 
Hours spent:The estimate hours is 2 hours. And I spent about 3 hours working
on it. I spent one more hour than I have expected since I spent a lot of 
time on adding x and y expressions.

I discussed with Ran and Yi about adding the x and y expression.
I had a problem with ParserTest and I solved it through piazza.
I also used some online resources on how to use regular expressions (http://www.regular-expressions.info/).

I find most parts of the assignment were not so difficult but adding x and y expressions was a 
little bit challenging for me.
